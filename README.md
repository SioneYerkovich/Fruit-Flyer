# ‚ÑπÔ∏è *Overview*
Welcome to Fruit Flyer! designed and developed by Sione Yerkovich. The purpose of this project was to develop a 2d game using the Unity Game Development Engine.

The game is a story driven, runner-style game. Inspired by the glory days of big names like Galaga, Space invaders and subway surfers. It was designed with one target market in mind: People who are bad at playing games! This was achieved by narrowing the spectrum
of conventional game controls, if you only have to press one button; it can't be too hard right? To combat this philosophy I have eased the player into the game, allowing them to become familiar with the physics and overall objective of the game. Slowly the game
becomes increasingly more challenging ensuring a good balance between challenge and frustration with equal satisfaction. Anyone can play!
It is a pixel game at heart, that features mostly hand drawn animations and artwork. 

Development was introduced with several requirements to be satisfied as follows:

***1. Start & Finish Section:*** Design a clear beginning and end, setting the stage for the adventure and providing a satisfying conclusion.

***2. Movement:*** Implement smooth and intuitive player movement that enhances the gameplay experience.

***3. Five Sections with Obstacles:*** Create five distinct sections. Each section should feature a unique obstacle or challenge that the player must overcome.

***4. Pause Menu:*** Include a pause menu with options to resume or quit the game.

***5. Timer:*** Integrate a timer. It could track the player‚Äôs progress, limit the time available to complete a section, countdown for specific challenges, or any other creative implementation that fits the game design.

***6. Checkpoint System:*** Develop a checkpoint system. I am free to interpret this concept in any way that fits the game design.

***7. Game Complete Screen:*** Design a game complete screen that celebrates the player‚Äôs success upon finishing the game.

***8. Sound Effects:*** Add at least three different sound effects to the game.

***9. Number of Lives:*** Implement a system that manages the number of lives a player has, which can range from a single life to unlimited lives. This adds a layer of challenge or flexibility to the game.

***10. Collisions:*** Ensure accurate collision detection to provide a realistic and responsive gameplay experience.

# üöÄ *Tech Stack*
I built this game using C#, the Unity Game Engine and Microsoft Visual Studios 2022.

C# controlled the logic of the game, from objective spawns all the way to cutscene logic and player movement. Basically every aspect of the game has some sort of script attached to it written using C#.

The Unity engine gave me an environment to simulate the games production. It allowed me to create prefabrications to re-use objects, attach physics systems, create particle animations and even design 2d games using 3d principles.

VS2022 was the IDE used to create all of my C# scripts for the game.

# üí≠ *Future Scope*
Additional stages expansion

"New game" feature to start from the beginning

New bosses including potentially Baron Von Vegetable!

All new powerups that enhance gameplay in various ways
